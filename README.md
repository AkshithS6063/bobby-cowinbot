                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}pin : update the pincode
                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}set_all : update above all in one go
            **To check the slot**
                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}slot_district : slots in district 
                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}slot_pin : slots in pincode
            **To change notification state**
                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}notify_on : enable hourly slot notifier
                :loudspeaker:  ${PREFIX}notify_off : disable hourly slot notifier
            Must use **${PREFIX}** as command prefix
